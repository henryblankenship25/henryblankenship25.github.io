        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
	
        <p>Greetings, I'm <b>Henry Blankenship</b>, an Electrical Engineering major at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I have interests in many different EE fields, but I am mostly interested in optics and photonics as well as robotics. I have hands-on experience in competitive prototyping environments through the FIRST Robotics Competition. Additionally I have prior internship experience and work experience in professional office environments.</p>

	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>I believe Electrical Engineering is one of the most important career fields as we head deeper into the 21st century. EE is an extremely important discipline for advancing human society into the modern age and leading us to living cleaner, greener lives. I would like to pursue a career in Electrical Engineering specifically in either photonics or optics. I believe that photonics will be one of the most important fields of EE in the future, not only because of its applications to solar energy, but also for its applications in the still nascent quantum computing field. Optics is also a field I am interested in due to my background as a hobbyist photographer as well as interest in potential new applications of optics for faster communications creating a more connected world of the future. <a href="about.htm"><b>Read More</b></a></p>

	<h3>Hobbies</h3>
	<div class="project">
	<p>Outside of the classroom I have several hobbies that I enjoy. Some of these hobbies relate to my ECE interests but some of them are completely unrelated. Regardless, several of my hobbies have served as inspirations for my interest in ECE.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Photography:</b> I have loved photography ever since I was younger when I was introduced to it by my father who was formerly a professional newspaper photographer. I love to take pictures of all sorts of things but I especially love architecture, landscapes, and sports. My love of digital photography is one of the things that got me interested in ECE since I was interested in the technology behind digital photography.</li><br>
<li><b>Gym: </b>I love working out with my friends at the gym. I mostly do strength training but I occasionally do cardio as well. The gym is one of my favorite hobbies because it keeps me active and lets me manage my weight better (no freshman 15 for me)</li><br>
<li><b>Outdoors/Hiking: </b>I've had a lifelong love of the outdoors stemming from my experince growing up among the beautiful forests of Georgia's piedmont region. I love to hike as well as ride my mountain bike in the outdoors. Being in the woods is one of my favorite ways to clear my mind and think clearly about a problem as well as to destress.</li><br>
<li><b>Sports: </b>I'm a lifelong fan of sports, both watching and playing. I'm a huge fan of the <span style="color: #B3A369;">Georgia Tech</span> Yellow Jackets (of course) as well as a lifelong fan of the <span style="color: #FF8200;">Tennessee Volunteers</span> and <span style="color: #f76800;">Mercer Bears</span> for college sports. I also am a big-time fan of the <span style="color: #CE1141;">Atlanta Braves</span> and an obligatory fan of the Hawks and Falcons. When playing sports some of my favorites are Football, Soccer, Baseball, and Track.</li><br>
<li><b>Language Learning: </b>I have been trying to learn Portuguese for the last 3 years. Learning foreign languages has fascinated me for most of my life and I plan to further expand the amount of languages I can speak in college and beyond.</li>
