	<h3>Hobbies</h3>
	<div class="project">
	<p>Outside of the classroom I have several hobbies that I enjoy. Some of these hobbies relate to my ECE interests but some of them are completely unrelated. Regardless, several of my hobbies have served as inspirations for my interest in ECE.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Photography:</b> I have loved photography ever since I was younger when I was introduced to it by my father who was formerly a professional newspaper photographer. I love to take pictures of all sorts of things but I especially love architecture, landscapes, and sports. My love of digital photography is one of the things that got me interested in ECE since I was interested in the technology behind digital photography.</li><br>
<li><b>Outdoors/Hiking: </b>I've had a lifelong love of the outdoors stemming from my experince growing up among the beautiful forests of Georgia's piedmont region. I love to hike as well as ride my mountain bike in the outdoors. Being in the woods is one of my favorite ways to clear my mind and think clearly about a problem as well as to destress.</li><br>
<li><b>Sports: </b>I'm a lifelong fan of sports, both watching and playing. I'm a huge fan of the <span style="color: #B3A369;">Georgia Tech</span> Yellow Jackets (of course) as well as a lifelong fan of the <span style="color: #FF8200;">Tennessee Volunteers</span> and Mercer Bears for college sports. I also am a big-time fan of the <span style="color: red">Atlanta Braves</span> and an obligatory fan of the Hawks and Falcons. When playing sports some of my favorites are Football, Soccer, Baseball, and Track.</li><br>
<li><b>Language Learning: </b>I have been trying to learn Portuguese for the last 3 years. Learning foreign languages has fascinated me for most of my life and I plan to further expand the amount of languages I can speak in college and beyond.</li>
