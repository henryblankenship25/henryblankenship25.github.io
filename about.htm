        <h2>About Me/Bio</h2>
	<a href="index.htm"><b>Return Home</b></a>
        <p>I believe Electrical Engineering is one of the most important career fields as we head deeper into the 21st century. EE is an extremely important discipline for advancing human society into the modern age and leading us to living cleaner, greener lives. I would like to pursue a career in Electrical Engineering specifically in either photonics or optics. I believe that photonics will be one of the most important fields of EE in the future, not only because of its applications to solar energy, but also for its applications in the still nascent quantum computing field. Optics is also a field I am interested in due to my background as a hobbyist photographer as well as interest in potential new applications of optics for faster communications creating a more connected world of the future.<br><br>
For me, electrical engineering has been one of my main interests ever since I was young. As a kid I was given a Snap Circuits toy kit which served to spark my initial interest in EE. I built every circuit in the manual and when I had exhausted that I would play around with how the different components worked. This gave me a strong foundational understanding of electricity and circuit design principles even from a young age. <br><br>
As I grew older my interest in EE grew due to my involvement in the FIRST Robotics Competition. I competed as a member of FRC Team 9260 Built4Bibb for 3 years in high school serving as electrical lead all 3 years and team captain my final two years. Through this program I gained lots of practical experience with electrical controls systems and electric motors. This experience taught me lots about teamwork, rapid brainstorming, prototyping, troubleshooting, and remembering that sometimes you may have to pivot. I learned lots during this time about different wire gauges, how to use tools such as a multimeter, various ways to connect wire splices, wire management, as well as troubleshooting issues that arose with our robot’s electrical systems. I also was a semi-finalist for the prestigious FIRST Dean’s List Award which is awarded to students showcasing characteristics of and exemplary FIRST student.<br><br>
I also gained EE work experience through my high school internship at the Georgia Tech Research Institute. This experience gave me a better understanding of what EE working environments are like as well as how it is to work with a team of fellow engineers on a project. I also learned a great deal about an EE field which was previously unknown to me which was RF engineering. From this internship I gained lots of knowledge about RF engineering before I had ever even taken a class on it! Overall, it was a very rewarding experience which helped me with picturing how I envisioned my future career.<br><br>
Coming back to my interests in optics and photonics as mentioned above, I gained an interest in these EE fields later on in high school much closer to senior year. It was during my junior year that I became much more interested in digital photography and due to my natural curiosity, I read all about the principles of the technology behind digital cameras. Learning about how digital image sensors, autofocus sensors, light meters, etc. worked led me to consider pursuing a career in optical engineering focused mostly on digital camera design. <br><br>
As I researched more on optical engineering I read more about photonics as well which led me to develop an interest. The field of photonics is not only very interesting to me, it also is an increasingly relevant field as applications of photonics show up more and more in our day-to-day lives. The main photonics related fields I am interested in pursuing are solar energy production, and quantum computing. I believe that both of these fields have the potential to revolutionize human society as we know it and will be leading forces in humanity’s advancement in the mid-21st century.<br><br>
One final thing that I believe strongly in is that I will never work in the defense industry. While I would join the military myself, something has always felt deeply morally wrong to me about creating instruments of death, whatever the intended application of them may be. Due to this I am only interested in careers and research that serve to further the human condition and encourage global prosperity and peace. I would like my life’s work to contribute to achieving the dream of a peaceful, prosperous, safe, green 21st century for all people, even if it is just a small drop in a larger bucket. I hope and believe that my work in the future as well as the work of other photonics and optical engineers will help to raise humanity to be a peaceful modern species benefiting from clean energy, more efficient computers and communications, more efficient light sources, and much more. (Better cameras too)
