          <h3>Breadboard Oscillator Circuit (ECE Discovery Project)</h3>
          <p><b>Objective:</b> Demonstrate basic principles of oscillator circuits as well as how to prototype on a breadboard</p>
          <p><b>Tools & Components:</b> Breadboard, wires, resistors, capacitors, CD40106 Inverter IC, battery, oscilloscope </p>
          <p><b>Skills Used:</b> circuit assembly, use of integrated circuits, use of breadboard, use of oscilloscope.</p>
	  <p><b>Summary:</b>For my discovery project I decided to experiment with some of the resources available to me in the Georgia Tech HIVE makerspace to make a basic oscillator circuit. My original proposal for the discovery project was to find a way to hack the hardware of my graphing calculator to use the I/O port as an audio port. The I/O port on this calculator was a mini audio jack so it technically could be used for audio by design. I spent a while looking into this and found that it was likely beyond my skill level though. Because of this I decided to pivot to an easier project that I would be able to complete without buying anything or having to worry about completion progress. <br><br>
The original proposed plan would have dealt with signal modulation due to the nature of producing digital audio signals. Because of this I decided to look into creating something vaguely related to signal modulation. I realized that it would be very difficult to design a new modulation system from scratch, so I decided to go with something even simpler and make a simple oscillator circuit. <br><br>
Because of the resources I had available at the hive I decided to make a breadboard based oscillator circuit. When researching different types of basic oscillator circuits, I determined that the Schmitt trigger RC oscillator was the simplest and easiest to replicate on the breadboard. I also found several past examples of Schmitt trigger based oscillators made using breadboards, so I knew my concept had a basis. <br><br>
The Schmitt trigger oscillator circuit is a simple circuit with a capacitor and then a Schmitt trigger and resistor wired in parallel to one another. Schmitt trigger oscillators work because the Schmitt trigger circuit, which converts analog electric values to a digital either high or low output. Because of this property the circuit will output a low signal when the capacitor is charging and then when the capacitor charges up and releases the Schmitt trigger will output the high signal until the capacitor is fully discharged. Because of this circuit’s properties as an RC circuit changing the Ohmage of the resistor or the Farads of the capacitor will change the frequency of the waveform. <br><br>
To create my circuit, I used a breadboard to replicate the circuit of a Schmitt trigger oscillator using a CD40106 Schmitt trigger inverter IC. Because of this my circuit also had to take into account providing supply power and ground for the IC so that the Schmitt trigger itself would function. I then placed the capacitor and resistor in place as they would be according to the circuit diagram and made an output channel so that I could hook my circuit up to an oscilloscope. <br><br>
I had never used an oscilloscope before this project so there was a definite learning curve to using one. I first had to figure out how to set the vertical axis so that I could actually see what I was doing. After figuring out this I also figured out how to set the horizontal axis. I still was left with a major problem which was that my signal appeared simply as a thick fuzzy line on screen. I could make out the proper signal when I zoomed on the axes but then it would go back to being fuzzy. After a while of reading I learned about the “trigger” setting of the oscilloscope. This setting allows you to more or less freeze the motion of a waveform that touches on the line set as the trigger voltage. With this figured out I was able to observe my waveform on the oscilloscope screen which was very satisfying. <br><br>
The one major problem I noticed with the waveform is that despite having the circuit wired correctly the waveform I was observing appeared to be a capacitor discharge waveform and not the square waveform that my design should have been making. I do not know what caused this issue, but it could be due to a faulty Schmitt trigger IC. If I could go back in time I would have traded my IC and tried a new one to make sure that the one, I was using wasn’t defective. <br><br>
Overall, this project was still rather successful since I acquainted myself with the HIVE space. This was also an informative experience since I learned how to use an oscilloscope and a bit about Schmitt trigger circuits. I also got to have fun playing around with different resistors and capacitors changing the frequency and observing this on the oscilloscope. <br><br>

          <h3>Ethical RF Hacking Educational Demo (GTRI Internship)</h3>
	  <p><b>Objective:</b> Create educational demo to teach about RF communications and ethical applications of RF hacking techniques</p>
          <p><b>Tools & Components:</b> HackRF Portapack, RC Cars, Dipole Antennas, Handheld UHF/VHF radios</p>
          <p><b>Skills Used:</b> spectral analysis, reverse engineering, RF signal capture and playback, use of various signal modulation techniques, technical instruction writing</p>	
          <p><b>Summary: </b><!--During my internship at Georgia Tech Research Institute, I worked with RF hacking devices such as the Flipper Zero and the HackRF Portapack to learn about RF hacking and ways that RF hacking techniques can be leveraged effecively. During the course of the summer internship I, as well as the other interns in my group, worked to earn our HAM Radio licenses, and in the process learned much about RF communications systems and the laws surrounding them. Following this our group worked mostly with the HackRF Portapack to find a way to interfere with and furthermore take control of RF controlled RC vehicles. Using our experience we created a demo-kit which could be used to demonstrate the abilities of RF and principles of RF hacking to younger audiences.--!>During my internship at Georgia Tech Research Institute, I worked with a team of other interns to develop an educational demonstration of RF hacking techniques. Specifically we intended to show how RF capture and playback could be used to hijack the control of an RC car. The demo was also designed to help explain links between RF hacking and more complicated RF Capture and Playback systems used in electronic warfare. 
Before working on this project, I had very little experience with RF engineering, because of this this internship was one of my most rewarding experiences. My group started by learning basic principles of RF and studying to take the HAM radio operator’s test. We needed to be licensed HAM operators to legally operate some of the equipment we used during the project and also studying for the license test is a very good way to learn some of the more complicated RF principles. <br><br>
	After earning our HAM licenses, we began to work on our main project, objective of hacking the RC car. First, we had to fix the front steering control of the RC car since the steering motor had burned out. We replaced it with another simple DC motor. We then used the FCC database to find what frequencies the car and controller used for communication and then used the spectral analysis tool on the HackRF to determine what type of modulation was used for the control emissions. Using this technique, we determined that the RC car used Frequency Modulation to transmit controls. We then used the HackRF to capture RF emissions from the controller when it was emitting. Using these captures we were able to playback the FM emissions from the controller and control the RC vehicle.<br><br>
	Following our success with the simple FM controlled car our supervisor challenged us to hack a more modern RC car which used 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi band RF emissions. This challenge proved to be much more difficult since the controller for this car used a Two-Way radio communication system consisting of signed digital packets similar to how Wi-Fi functions. We were still able to determine the emission frequencies for this car using the same procedure involving the FCC documentation as the last car. Using this we were able to use spectral analysis on the emissions of the car controller to determine that the modulation type for this controller was Four Level Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying. There were no published docs from the manufacturer detailing how the 4-gFSK signal was modulated and due to our inexperience in RF we had difficulty determining a way to properly reverse engineer the modulation for this car. Because of this, we were unable to properly hack the more advanced 2.4 GHz car, but we did write about our discoveries on how its control system worked in our educational packet. <br><br>
Finally, we prepared the final educational demo. We made a pelican case with all of the different components required for the demo. We also wrote detailed instructions for every component and how to use them in the demo. Finally we prepared a PowerPoint of our findings and presented it to other GTRI high school interns and community members.
