        <h2>Career Goals Timeline</h2>
        <p>My long-term goal is to work towards a career working with optics and phtonics in a consumer or research application. I'm interested in working in either digital camera technology, or with solar energy technology. This is a comprehensive outline for the steps I plan on taking to achieve my goals and make them reality.</p>

          <li>Work on completing my EE General Core requirements and prerequisite courses for later EE Common Core classes.</li>
          <li>Complete at least ECE 1100 and ECE 2020 in my ECE Common Core requirements</li>
          <li>Join GT Offroad to get more hands on EE experience</li>

        <h3>2026-2027 - Sophomore Year</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Continue working toward EE General Core reuqirments hopefully finishing out final math and physics requirments in the first semester of this year</li>
          <li>Begin focusing more on EE Common Core classes hopefully completing ECE 2026, ECE 2031, ECE 2035, and ECE 2040 by the end of this year.</li>
          <li>Work in undergraduate research to gain further hands on EE experience </li>
	<li>Continue to be active in GT Offroad and potentially join another more EE related club to get further experience</li>
	<li>Work towards expanding my communications skill by starting on learning a foreign language</li>
	<li>Once again apply to summer internships. This time potentially look into out-of-state internship options.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2027-2028 - Junior Year</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Continue to complete ECE Common Core Classes</li>
          <li>Begin to work on classes for my threads. I have tentatively chosen the Circuit Design, and Electronic Devices threads. I believe that these 	   threads will be most beneficial for working towards a career in the industries I am interested in.</li>
          <li>Try to study abroad spring semester to broaden my horizons (pun intended). Probably study in either another English speaking country or either Portugal or Brazil if my Portuguese skills are adequete at that point.</li>
	  <li>Do VIP (Vertically Integrated Projects) or continue with undergrad research</li>
	  <li>Apply for BS/MS program in optics and photonics engineering</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Take remaining thread course requirements</li>
          <li>Begin applying to full time jobs in second semester. Potentially revisit companies I have previously interned for.</li>

	<li>Only do this program if accepted Junior year</li>
	<li>Expand on learning in my interest area by working towards an EE masters degree with an interest area in optics and photonics.</li>
	<li>Begin applying to full time jobs in industry or jobs in research labs.</li>

        <h3>2030-2035 Early Career</h3>
        <p>
	My goals for my early career are to earn a junior position in either optics or photonics. For purposes of quality of life I would prefer to work at a company headquartered or with offices somewhere in a major urban area preferably the Northeast. I plan to keep whatever junior position I have for 3-4 years until I either get promoted or seek employment elsewhere. Because of the additional experience I would gain from this my marketability would increase allowing me to seek better jobs. I plan on iterating this process until I find a position where I feel satisified with the QOL or I feel truly passionate about the work I'm doing to a point of being attached to the company.<br><br>
Alternatively if the job market is poor upon my graduation and I am unable to find employment I will join the Navy as an officer. With my experience in EE I would have a wide range of options for what career within the Navy I could choose. I would likely opt for something more technical such as, Flight Officer, pilot, or explosive ordinance disposal. If I took this route I would probably stay within the Navy for 20 years or more before retiring so that I can start collecting my retirement benefits in my 40s. After this
